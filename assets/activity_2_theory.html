<p> The team of thoreticians in Microwave Spectroscopy Laboratory of Institute
  of 
  Applied Physics  Russian Academy of Sciences (IAP) has long and successful
  history in studying  light molecules. First theoretical works studying water
  spectrum were published in  early 80-s. Originally the analysis was done using
  effective Hamiltonians. <br>
  Leader of the theoretical group of the laboratory O.L. Polyansky in 1985 
  proposed Pade-Borel method of series summation since then widely used for 
  studying water and related molecules spectra. Since early 90-s progress in
   computational hardware and 'software' lead to variational calculations taking
  the bigger part in analyzing triatomic molecules spectra. In particular the
  program suit DVR3D for variational calculations of vibration-rotation energy
  levels using the exact kinetic energy operator for nuclear motion was developed  in
  the group of Prof. J. Tennyson University College London. This development
  had given start to very successful cooperation between IAP RAS and UCL. The
  UK 
  being experts in the variational calculations with Russian side being experts
  in analysis of complicated experimental spectra. </p>
<p> During the last 10 years tens of thousands transitions of water were 
    analyzed and assigned in broad frequency range from far IR to near
    UV, the most known being study of sun sport spectrum, published in 'Science'.
    The accuracy of variational calculations is mostly determined by the quality
  of used potential energy surface (PES). The team took part in development
    of 
    several semiemperical PESes for H2O and H2S which were the best at the time.
  In recent years ab initio PESes are starting to play the leading role in 
    improving accuracy of calculations. It's also important to take into 
    consideration corrections to Born-Oppenheimer surface. Members of the team
  actively worked in all these fields leading to publication in 'Science' 
    describing the methodology of obtaining ab initio PES of water which gives
  energy levels with standard deviation 1 cm-1.    </p>
<p>In summation: members of IAP RAS thoretical team are experts in 
      analysis of complicated experimental spectra, development of ab initio
  methods,      PES optimization by fitting to observed vibration-rotation energy
  levels. Their expertise is confirmed by about 100 publications on studying
  water 
      and related molecules spectra. <br>
