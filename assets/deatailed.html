<div class="zag">Submillimeter-Wave Spectrometer with a BWO and the Acoustic Detector (RAD)</div>
<p class="p_l">Spectrometer Classification</p>
<P>All existing spectrometers may be divided into two main 
classes (Fig. 1) according to two methods of obtaining the signal from the 
spectral lines of the sample investigated. The first method involves registering 
the change in microwave radiation power after passage through the sample; the 
second involves registering the change in one or more sample parameters under 
the action of the radiation. Considering the region of spectrometer operation 
close to the sensitivity limit, one may assume that the fraction of power 
absorbed by the sample <I>P</I><SUB>s</SUB> is small, i.e., 
<I>P</I><SUB>s</SUB><I>&lt;&lt;P</I><SUB>0</SUB> , where <I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB> is 
the microwave radiation source power. Thus, in the first class of spectrometers 
the useful signal <I>P</I><SUB>s</SUB> must be observed in the presence of a 
large (noninformative) background <I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB><I>,</I> and this is the 
main source of sensitivity-decreasing phenomena (including the increase of 
noise, appearance of false signals, etc.). </p>
<p>The microwave spectrometers commonly 
used are devices of the first class and the above circumstances limit their 
absorption coefficient sensitivity to a value of the order of 10<SUP>-10</SUP> 
cm<SUP>-1</SUP> at a time constant of 1 sec, and limit the allowed power to a 
value of 10<SUP>-3</SUP> W. Spectrometers of the second class look more 
promising since the null signal detection principle for the microwave power is 
intrinsic to them, and only the useful signal <I>P</I><SUB>s</SUB> is 
registered. The detector noise in the absence of spectral lines does not depend 
on the radiation power passing through the sample and the absorption coefficient 
sensitivity increases at a rate proportional to the radiation power up to power 
levels causing transition saturation or breakdown in the gas. </p>
<p>The absence of 
detector reaction outside the spectral lines also eliminates false signals. As a 
result, the absorption coefficient sensitivity of microwave spectrometers of the 
second class (when powerful enough radiation sources are used) may significantly 
exceed the aforementioned figure of 10<SUP>-10</SUP> cm<SUP>-1</SUP> at a time 
constant of 1 sec.</P>
<p class="pod"><img src="img/ClasSpec.jpg"><br>Fig.1.</p>
<p class="p_l">General description</p>
<p>In the RAD (Fig. 2) the radiation of the primary monochromatic submillimeter source — the BWO — passes through one or several successively placed cells containing the gases investigated and is then directed to the mixer-multiplier of the BWO stabilization and frequency measurement system. When the radiation frequency coincides with the frequency of the spectral line the gas absorbs the power, heats, and produces a pressure increase in the cell (gas sounding when absorbing modulated radiation was discovered at the end of the nineteenth century).</p>
<p class="pod"><img src="img/RADspec.jpg"><br>Fig.2.</p>
<P>The amplitude or frequency of the BWO radiation is modulated 
with an audio range modulation frequency. The spectral component of the gas 
pressure variations at the modulation frequency is the signal from the 
absorption line registered by the sensitive microphone placed in the cell. After 
amplification and synchronous detection the signal is recorded. The BWO 
radiation frequency may be scanned electronically by approximately an octave, 
which permits making a record of the absorption spectrum of the gas. According 
to the classification given above, the RAD belongs to the second class of 
spectrometers because of the manner of signal formation from the line. </P>
<P>This leads (besides the aforementioned possibility of a 
sensitivity increase) to the following properties important in practice: (i) the 
use of high power radiation sources without an increase in receiver noise opens 
new perspectives in nonlinear spectroscopy; (ii) the thermal volume "null" 
signal detection provides independence of the sensitivity on the radiation 
frequency and the absence of false signals from interference effects, which in 
conjunction with electronic control of the BWO frequency permits carrying out 
automatic records of broad parts of the spectrum; (iii) the signal formation 
(for the majority of spectral lines) from a small fraction of the radiation 
power passing through the cell permits making simultaneous independent records 
of several gas spectra in several absorption cells with microphones, and the 
utilization of the full radiation power passing through the cells in the system 
for stabilization and measurement of the BWO frequency. </P>

<a href="index.html#/instrum/devices/dev004" target="_blank">Device 004</a>
<P>The gas cell, microphone, and electronic 
detector circuit (Fig. 3) must provide the maximum signal-to-noise ratio for 
weak lines <I>(<FONT face=Symbol>g</FONT> l <FONT face=Symbol>&lt;</FONT> <FONT 
face=Symbol>&lt;</FONT> </I>1<I>)</I> for given resolving power of the 
spectrometer and radiation power passing through the cell 
circuit.</P>
<p class="pod"><img src="img/SchemRAD.jpg"><br>Fig.3.</p>
<p>The conditions for maximum condenser microphone output signal by the microphone placed in the cell are:</p>
<P class="p_z"><font face=Symbol>w</font><SUB>M</SUB><font 
face=Symbol>t</font><SUP> cell</SUP> <font face=Symbol>»</font> 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;  (1)</P>
<P class="p_z"><I>m </I>= <font 
face=Symbol>p</font><I>p</I>R<SUP>4</SUP>/8<I>VT</I>* <font face=Symbol>»</font> 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;(2)</P>
<P>Equation (1) relates the angular modulation frequency (<font 
face=Symbol>w</font><SUB>M</SUB>) and the time constant of the thermal processes 
<font face=Symbol>t</font><SUP>cell</SUP>, and provides maximum amplitude of gas 
pressure variations. Equation (2) relates the gas and membrane elasticities and 
provides the most effective transformation of the pressure variations into 
membrane displacements. Calculations are made for the real case in which the 
membrane elasticity is defined by its initial tension and the frequency of free 
oscillations of the membrane in vacuum is much greater than the modulation 
frequency. Here <I>p</I> is the gas pressure, <I>V</I> is the cell volume, 
<I>R</I> and <I>T*</I> are the radius and initial tension of the membrane 
(<I>T*</I> is the force per unit edge length). Analysis of these matching 
conditions and the expression for the signal strength obtained in this case 
permit the following conclusions: (i) When the matching conditions are 
fulfilled, the signal increases slowly with decreasing modulation frequency. The 
minimum modulation frequency is then defined by environmental noise. (ii) The 
operating pressure is sufficiently strictly defined by the desired resolving 
power of the spectrometer. Hence from Eq. (1) we obtain the value of the 
smallest (transverse) dimension of the cell. (iii) For given membrane parameters 
the signal strength increases with increasing cell length only up to a value 
defined by Eq. (2). Upon further increasing the cell length, the signal strength 
is saturated. (iv) The dependence of the matching Eqs. (1) and (2) on the gas 
pressure leads to the dependence of the output signal on pressure.</P>
<P>The realization of the matching condition <I>m</I> <font 
face=Symbol>»</font> 1 at small gas pressures is the most difficult problem in 
practice, even when rather thin membranes are used (a membrane is stiffer than 
gas, <I>m&nbsp;</I>&lt;<font face=Symbol>&lt;</font>1). In this case the signal 
drops proportionally to <I>m.</I> The maximum close approach to fulfillment of 
Eq. (2) is very desirable from the point of view of requirements for the 
sensitivity of the electronics circuit.</P>
<P>The spectrometer output noise is defined by the thermal 
fluctuations of the microphone membrane in the gas (both due to inherent 
Brownian motion of the membrane and to Brownian motion of the gas) and by the 
inherent noise of the electronics circuit. The limiting sensitivity of the 
spectrometer is obtained when the thermal fluctuations of the membrane are 
defined preferably by Brownian motion of the gas. In this case the parameters 
are practically unrestricted, since the gas noise and the signal are similarly 
transformed into membrane displacements. Only the weak dependence on the cell 
length remains. The signal-to-noise ratio increases as <I>l<SUP>1/2</SUP>,</I> 
because the effective volume thermal noise sources do not correlate between each 
other, but the signal sources do. In the absence of line saturation for <I>T</I> = 
 300°K, <I>l</I> = 10 cm, an integration time of 1 sec, and a typical gas 
thermal conductivity, one may obtain the following estimate for the limiting 
absorption coefficient sensitivity of the RAD:</P>
<P class="p_z"><I><font face=Symbol>g</font> </I><SUB>min</SUB>(cm 
<SUP>-1</SUP>) <font face=Symbol>»</font> 4 x 
10<SUP>-11</SUP>/<I>P<SUB>0</SUB></I>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3)</P>
<P>where <I>P<SUB>0</SUB></I> is in watts. An analogous estimate 
may be obtained more roughly using Eq. (4) and the expression for the signal 
power <I>P<SUB>s</SUB><font face=Symbol>»g</font> lP<SUB>0</SUB> .</I> Let us 
consider the possibilities of achieving this ultimate sensitivity.</P>
<P>The rms displacement of the center of the membrane due to 
fluctuations connected with Brownian motion in the gas (at <font 
face=Symbol>w</font><SUB>M</SUB><font face=Symbol>t</font><SUP>cell</SUP><font 
face=Symbol>»</font>1, <I>m</I><font face=Symbol>&lt;&lt;</font>1) in the 
receiver bandwidth <font face=Symbol>Dw</font><SUP>rec</SUP> near the modulation 
frequency is equal to</P>

<P>Here <font face=Symbol>W</font> and <I>Q</I><SUB>M</SUB> are 
the resonant frequency and quality factor of the membrane as a mechanical 
oscillator in vacuum. For the parameter values <I>Q</I><SUB>M</SUB><font

<font face=Symbol>s</font><SUB>g</SUB> is 5x10<SUP>-5</SUP> Angstrom.</P>
<P>The electronic circuit must register these rather small 
fluctuation displacements of the membrane with very weak tension. When the cell 
is evacuated and filled with the gas to be investigated, considerable 
displacements of the membrane may occur. These must not influence the 
sensitivity of the microphone and circuit in the subsequent operation. The most 
suitable circuit for fulfilling these conditions is the high-frequency bridge 
condenser microphone circuit with the microphone capacity included in one 
resonant bridge arm. It will be shown below that the sensitivity of such a 
circuit is sufficient for detection of gas fluctuations. The use of an automatic 
bridge balance along two coordinates (microphone capacity by electrostatic 
control of the membrane position, the circuit losses by an electrically 
controlled resistor) provides constant sensitivity of the microphone and the 
circuit.</P>
<P>When the bridge is fed by a quartz oscillator with a 
sufficiently pure spectrum, then the noise in the narrow sidebands <font 
face=Symbol>Dw</font><SUP>rec </SUP>at the frequencies <font 
face=Symbol>w</font><SUB>q</SUB>±<font face=Symbol>w</font><SUB>M</SUB> is

membrane and is approximately equal to 10<SUP>2</SUP>. The value 
<I>P</I><SUB>q</SUB> may be increased until the electrostatic attractive force

<P align=justify>and when the value <I>d/P<SUB>q</SUB><SUP>1/2 </SUP></I>is near

<P>Assuming membrane fluctuations to predominate over fluctuations 
of the circuit, one may obtain the condition for <font

face=Symbol>w</font><SUB>q</SUB>&nbsp;&gt;=10<SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;Hz, which is easy 
to fulfill.</P>
<P>The relatively small dimensions of the RAD absorption cells in 
comparison with the cells of common microwave spectrometers have some advantages 
for a number of investigations (free radicals, Stark and Zeeman effects, etc.). 
At present, the experimentally obtained RAD sensitivity is equal to</P>

<p>(with <I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB> in watts), which is rather close to the 
  theoretical value in Eq. (3). In particular, at the wavelength of 0.75 mm, where
