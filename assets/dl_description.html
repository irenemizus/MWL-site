<p>The block-diagram of the apparatus is 
presented in Fig. 1. The Fabry-Perot resonator (<A 
href="dev011.html" target="_blank">Device 011</A>) uses fundamental TEM (00q) mode, 
where q is longitudinal mode number, i.e., number of halfwavelengths 
between mirrors. The quality factor of Fabry-Perot resonator, 25-42 cm 
long, spherical silver-plated mirrors 12 cm in diameter and 24 cm curvature 
radius, coupled with source and detector by 6 micrometer teflon film, placed 
 45 degrees to the resonator axis, is determined by unavoidable reflection 
losses (silver is the best reflecting material in millimeter wave range). </p>

  Fig. 1. Block - Diagram of the experimental setup of the resonator millimeter-wave spectrometer.
  Radiation source is BWO with frequency  controlled by PLL including slow MW and fast RF
  reference synthesizers. The sensor is a high-Q Fabry-Perot resonator. The Schottky diode is the detector of the radiation passed through the resonator. Computer performs control of synthesizers, data acquisition and processing. </p>
<P> It is known that the width of the resonance can be 
written as </P>
<P class="p_z"><FONT face=Symbol>D</FONT> f = cP<SUB>total </SUB>/ 2<FONT 
face=Symbol>p</FONT> L ,</P>
<P>where c is the light velocity in a substance, <I>L </I>is the 
resonator length and <I>P<SUB>total</SUB></I> are total relative losses of 
radiation energy during one traversing of the resonator. The length <I>L</I> is 
defined in our case as</P>
<p class="pod"><img src="img/Image5.gif"></p> 
<P>where <font face=Symbol>l</font> - wavelength in the substance, 
R – mirrors radius of curvature, q - number of halfwavelengths 
between mirrors.</P>
<P>Total losses in the Fabry-Perot cavity P<sub>total</sub> 
consist of:</P>
<P class="p_z">P<sub>total</sub> = P<sub>reflection </sub>+ 
P<sub>coupling </sub>+ P<sub>diffraction </sub>+ P<sub>atmosphere 
</sub><sub>,</sub></P>
<P>and one needs some additional procedure to separate the loss to 
be measured. Expressions for all the losses are known with higher or lower 
accuracy: losses in the atmosphere filling the resonator can be calculated using 
MPM program written by H. Liebe and its updates; diffraction coupling and 
reflection losses can be calculated using expressions from classical books.</P>
<P>The synthesized frequency radiation source 
is based on a Backward Wave Oscillator (BWO) which is stabilized by Phase Lock-in Loop 
(PLL) with the use in this case of two reference synthesizers: one microwave (MW) 
synthesizer (8-12 GHz), determining central frequency of the BWO and fast radio 
frequency (RF) synthesizer (20-40 MHz) for precision fast scanning of the BWO 
frequency around the chosen central frequency.</P>
<P>Radio frequency synthesizer provides 
frequency scanning without loss of the phase of oscillations (without phase 
jumps). Both synthesizers are computer-controlled. As a result, BWO frequency is 
defined as </P>
<P class="p_z">f<sub><SMALL>BWO</SMALL></sub> = n <font 
face=Symbol><SMALL><SMALL><SMALL>·</SMALL></SMALL></SMALL></font> 
f<sub><SMALL>MW</SMALL></sub> – 10 <SMALL><SMALL><SMALL><font 
face=Symbol>·</font></SMALL></SMALL></SMALL> f<sub><SMALL>RF</SMALL></sub> ,</P>
<P>where n varied from 4 to 20, and factor 10 before 
f<sub>RF</sub> appears because phase detection is done at 10 times 
digitally divided intermediate frequency (IF) which was 350 MHz. The main source
 of error in measurement of the resonance width is the drift of the central 
frequency of resonance during the measurement. To minimize this error
 one has to measure the resonance curve as fast as physically possible. Response

time of the resonator itself <font face=Symbol>t</font> <font 
face=Symbol>~</font> 1/<font face=Symbol>p</font> <font face=Symbol>D</font> 
f<font face=Symbol>~</font>2 microseconds. For precision measurement the 
observation time should be increased, say, ten times, i.e., up to ~20 
microseconds. Microwave and millimeter-wave synthesizers commonly used for 
spectroscopy, employ indirect frequency synthesis and so have 
~&nbsp;10&nbsp;<SMALL><font 
face=Symbol><SMALL><SMALL>·</SMALL></SMALL></font></SMALL>&nbsp;50 millisecond
 switching time, thus preventing fast scanning of the resonance curve. Fast 
direct radio frequency synthesizer with switching time ~200 nanoseconds and time
 between switching 58 microseconds was used in this work as a source of reference

signal for phase detector in the lock-in loop. Thus precision and fast scanning
 of the BWO radiation frequency within ~200 MHz around the central frequency

defined by microwave frequency synthesizer was achieved. Extension
of the scanning range up to the full BWO frequency range is possible [<a href="2006.html" target="_blank">Ref.
2 (2006)</a>]. Scanning
        without
        
loss of phase permits the physical limits of the resonance observation time
         to be approached and reduces the source phase noise. The passed through resonator radiation
        was
      received then by low-barrier Schottky diode detector. The precision frequency
         control, signal acquisition and processing were done by computer as
  it is shown
      in Fig. 1 and will be explained below. Results of each scan were recorded
    and
  processed separately.</P>
<P>Automation system consisted of IBM PC and module containing RF 
synthesizer and data acquisition system. For minimization of ground-to-ground 
static the module is connected with PC by optically coupled interface. The core 
of the module is microprocessor with external memory. RF synthesizer is based on 
Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) microcircuit AD9850 of Analog Devices Inc. and 
it is able to generate harmonic signal in 20-40&nbsp;MHz range with 0.03 Hz 
discreteness and without phase jumps at the switching. Data acquisition 
(digitizing of preamplified detector signal) is done by 12-digits ADC. Data are 
stored in a data memory. Microprocessor controls frequency of synthesizer and 
synchronizes the data acquisition process with frequency steps. Parameters of 
the synthesizer frequency tuning - starting frequency, value of frequency step, 
time of the next frequency step, number of points, frequency change law and 
number of scans - the microprocessor receives from PC. Time between frequency 
changing was chosen for our purpose as 60 microseconds per point. Frequency was 
changed by triangle law meaning forward and backward scan. Maximum number of 
points per scan was 512. In each frequency point microprocessor several times 
collects data from ADC, averages the obtained results and put the result of 
averaging into data memory. In such a way 32 of 512 points triangle scans may be 
put into local memory. The number of scans which could be put into local memory 
increases proportionally with reducing the number of points per scan. So process 
of registration of 32 scans with 512 points per scan takes 0.98 sec. After the 
recording of ordered number of scans into local memory the data are transferred 
to PC for further processing.</P>
<P>The processing consists of least squares fitting of the results 
of each scan to Lorentzian with added linear (practice showed no necessity in 
quadratic term) and constant terms representing effects of interference in the 
tract in the vicinity of resonance, level of noise on detector and bias voltage 
of amplifier:</P>
<p class="pod"><img src="img/Image6.gif"></p>
<p>As a result of the fit the width of the resonance 
<FONT face=Symbol>D</FONT> f and position of the center 
f<SUB>0</SUB> are obtained. The time necessary for the fitting of one scan 
depends primarily on the scan size and type of the PC processor. With 
P120 processor and 1024-points scan this time varies from split second to 
several seconds depending on the noise level. This time is defined for one 
single scan without use of the results of the processing of previous scan. The 
next scan processing time can be reduced down to some tens of milliseconds by 
use of the previous scan processing result as initial fitting parameters. It is 
clear that some of non-physical time losses can be reduced, e.g., just by the 
change of the processor.</p>
<P>The basic procedure in resonator 
spectroscopy is measurement of width of the resonance. The example of 
experimentally observed resonant curve of the Fabry-Perot resonator at 
85 GHz is presented in Fig.2. </P>
<p class="pod"><img src="img/cav_prf2.gif">
<br>Fig. 2. Resonance curve of Fabry-Perot resonator 
record (500 centered scans). Residual of the fit to the Lorentzian curve 
multiplied by 100 is presented below. Measured width of the resonance (FWHM) at 
the frequency 85.139 GHz is equal to <FONT face=Symbol>D</FONT> f = 
164 728 (20) Hz.</p>

<p>The curve is a combination of 500 scans with a duration 
of 30 ms each, i.e., corresponds to the summary averaging time 15 s. Each fast scan 
was processed separately, then resonant curves were combined so that their centers 
coincided, and so was obtained the averaged curve in Fig. 2. Residual of the 
fit, presented in the lower part of the figure indicates adequacy of the fitting model. 
The increased noise on the line slopes corresponds to transformation of phase 
noises of radiation into amplitude ones. The width of the resonance (FWHM) was 
defined then as <FONT face=Symbol>D</FONT> <I>f </I>= 
164 728 (20) Hz. Of course, to obtain only averaged value 
of the width one can just average values of the widths obtained by processing  
each scan.</p>
<p class="pod"><img src="img/widths.gif"><br>
Fig. 3. Convergence of measured width of the resonance curve of Fabry-Perot resonator with the number of measurements. 
Results of forward (curve F) and backward (curve B) scans are presented separately, demonstrating existence of the fast drifts of the center resonance 
frequency even at scan times as short as 30~ms. Average of back and forth scans is shown (medium curve).</p>
<P>In Fig. 3 some inside story of obtaining  
the resonator width value by means of averaging  each single scan processing 
result is shown. The width is plotted vs. the number of averaged measurements: thin 
curves depict results of only forward (F) and only backward (B) 
frequency scans; thick curve depicts the mean value of these two. Every point 
corresponds to twenty times averaged value of width obtained from processing of 
30 ms duration single scans. The curves in Fig. 3 show not only 
the effect of measurement accuracy increase with data accumulation - after 340 
averaging the mean value of back and forth scans varies within 10 Hz - but also 
the significance of the fast frequency scan introduced by us for faster 
obtaining of the data as well as for lessening  the measurement errors arising 
from the resonance center frequency drift. The difference between width values 
measured with opposite directions of the scan reaches 400 Hz due to the drift of 
the center frequency of the resonance during the time of the scan even for scans 
as fast as 30 milliseconds. The change from slower scans used earlier (10 s) to the 
30 ms scan is in some sense equivalent to the change to modulation method (with 
30 Hz modulation frequency) leaving behind most part of  flicker type drifts 
and perturbations.</P>
<P> The sensitivity of the spectrometer in  
terms of the absorption coefficient determined from 20 Hz resonance width 
measurement accuracy constitutes ~&nbsp;4&nbsp;<SMALL><FONT
