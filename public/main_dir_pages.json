In a simplest hypothetical case of 2-level molecules, the molecular dipole produces a train of harmonic oscillations between two successive collisions. Averaging over gas (autocorrelation) gives a almost exponentially decreasing envelop of the oscillations. Its spectrum is a well known bell-shaped function at the frequency of oscillations having width equal to the reversed duration of oscillations.</p><p>Within the impact approximation (instant collisions), a collisional line shape is very close to the Lorentz one. It fits well the real line near its center. Actually, collision takes finite time. The train of oscillations breaks down smoothly. This leads to exponential decay of the far line wings (sub-Lorentz behavior). The breaking function of the oscillation train is determined by interaction potential that is unknown as a rule. Fortunately, the difference in the line shape of the impact approximation and the real case becomes noticeable only at very significant frequency detuning from the line center. So, the line is usually divided into a resonance part and a pedestal, which is usually attributed to continuum absorption. Note that the major collisional lineshape parameters such as pressure shifting, collisional broadening and its speed dependence, collisional coupling etc. are also determined by the same interaction potential, in particular, by its long-range part. The number of collisions per unit time varies linearly with molecular number density (or pressure). Therefore, all collisional parameters also vary linearly with pressure. This linearity is experimentally confirmed in a very broad range of pressures.</p><p>It was believed that the line wing at large detuning is always sub-Lorentzian and that &ldquo;<em>super-Lorentzian line shape is not supported by any known physics</em>&rdquo;. We found the missing mechanism. If the dipole oscillation breaking function is not monotonous (a light molecule can make several full turns during typical collision time), then the corresponding line wing has a broad hill at detuning equal to the characteristic frequency of this non-monotonic behavior. The width of the hill is determined by collision duration. See [<a href=\"index.html#/list/2017\" target=\"blank\">Ref.&nbsp;4 (2017)</a>] and references therein for more details.</p>"

The <a href=\"index.html#/instrum/reson/dimer\">observed sequence</a> of 13 rotational peaks consists from a large number of overlapped lines (E-type transitions) corresponding to the end over end rotation of water dimer. At room temperature, the sequence is supposed to reach a broad maximum located around 20&nbsp;cm<sup>-1</sup> (600&nbsp;GHz). This spectral signature of bound water dimer has been predicted in this region by <em>ab initio</em> and classical calculations. It is supposed to be superposed to a broad absorption pedestal smoothly increasing with frequency, due to the overlapping of lines of A- and B-type transitions of bound water dimer. In real water vapor similar smooth pedestal from quasibound states of the dimer is expected. Such deviation of the water vapor continuum frequency dependence from a quadratic function (expected in earlier studies in mm and far IR ranges) is fully confirmed by our measurement of water vapor self-continuum in the 15&ndash;35&nbsp;cm<sup>-1</sup> (450&ndash;1000&nbsp;GHz) range using FT spectrometer at <a href=\"https://www.synchrotron-soleil.fr/en/beamlines/ailes\" target=\"blank\">AILES beamline of SOLEIL synchrotron</a>. The figure presents all available from the literature experimental data about water vapor self-continuum in terms of spectral function (self-continuum cross-section normalized by frequency squared) together with the water dimer spectral function obtained from quantum chemical calculations. The broad absorption maximum due to the dimer rotational absorption near 20&nbsp;cm<sup>-1</sup> is transformed into a characteristic sharp slope of the spectral function. Very good agreement of the observed continuum with the water dimer predictions confirms the dominant contribution of the water dimer absorption to the continuum in this region.
