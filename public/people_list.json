          "biography": "<p>Andrey&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Krupnov was born on January 31, 1934 in the village of Kirghiz-Miaki of the Bashkir ASSR, where military service brought his parents (Muscovites, medical doctors by education). After World War&nbsp;II, the family settled in Gorky. Andrey received his higher education in 1953&ndash;1957 at the Radiophysics Faculty of the Gorky State University. His diploma thesis &ldquo;Measuring the technical radiation band width of the 10-cm generator&rdquo; was prepared on a radio telescope in Zimenki. His supervisor, <a href=\"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9,_%D0%92%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87\" target=\"_blank\">V.S.&nbsp;Troitsky</a> (at that time Ph.D., later corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences), set the right &ldquo;vector of the development&rdquo; and actually predetermined the future fate of the young scientist by inviting him to work at the Radiophysical Research Institute (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiophysical_Research_Institute\" target=\"_blank\">NIRFI</a>) after graduation. The work on the diploma and the conversations with Troitsky were very important. It was then that Andrey realized for the first time what he was studying for to make something new. From then on he always preferred the development of new methods, as they give new results.</p> <p>In 1959 V.S.&nbsp;Troitsky included A.&nbsp;Krupnov in the group studying molecular generators. At that time, it was not yet clear what beam masers could be used for. His first contribution to this field (and the subject of his <a href=\"https://mwl.ipfran.ru/index.html#/list/1959-1977\" target=\"_blank\">first scientific paper</a> published in 1959) was a ring sorting system proposed by him. The proposed system proved to be successful and was later used by N.G.&nbsp;Basov and A.M.&nbsp;Prokhorov. In 1963, it was &ldquo;re-invented&rdquo; by G.&nbsp;Becker, Head of the Department of Time and Frequency of the National Metrology Institute of Germany. A description of the system can be found in the section &ldquo;Basic Technique&rdquo; of the book &ldquo;Atomic and Molecular Beam Methods&rdquo;, Oxford University Press, 1988. A formaldehyde-based millimeter-wave molecular generator was launched in 1962. These works of Krupnov were referred to in a large number of reviews and books and laid the basis for his PhD thesis that was defended at the Gorky State University in 1965. At that time, A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov worked in tandem with V.A.&nbsp;Skvortsov, who defended his PhD two years later. Among the many jointly performed studies, the 1967 research is of special notice. It was devoted to the spectrometer operating at a frequency of about 24&nbsp;GHz with a 2-meter long molecular beam and a record resolution of 240&nbsp;Hz. The record was surpassed only 50 years later. This period of Andrey’s work is marked by a whole page of references (20 references) in R.&nbsp;Laine's review (<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231066623_Molecular_beam_masers\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Molecular Beam Masers&rdquo;, Rep. Progr. Phys, 33, 1001&ndash;1067, 1970</a>]. At that time, the world community carefully read the articles in Soviet Radiophysics, where Krupnov published almost all his results.</p> <p>After defending his PhD, A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov decided to take up &ldquo;submillimeters&rdquo; with the use of wide-range generators &mdash; backward-wave oscillators (BWO), developed at the Institute of Radio Electronics, Fryazino, Moscow region. This activity began with measurement of the frequency of the first rotational transitions of an ammonia molecule near 0.57&nbsp;THz, which had not yet been investigated by precise methods of radio spectroscopy. The culture of high-precision measurements with the use of phase-locked loop (PLL) systems of generator radiation, developed when working with masers, was of great help. Almost simultaneously (with a small priority of Krupnov's team, who submitted an <a href=\"https://mwl.ipfran.ru/index.html#/list/1959-1977\" target=\"_blank\">article to Radiophysics</a> in May 1967), these same rotational transitions of ammonia were measured by W.&nbsp;Gordy, who at that time was considered to be a global monopolist in the submillimeter field (the article was submitted to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.188.100\" target=\"_blank\">Physical Review</a> in July 1969). The results coincided for ordinary ammonia, but not for isotopic ammonia. After numerous thorough checks, Krupnov decided not to write an article, but a letter to Gordy, who a year later admitted his mistake in an <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2852(71)90280-3\" target=\"_blank\">article in the Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy (1971)</a>. The world noticed that there appeared someone who was able to correct Gordy. Krupnov received Gordy's book with an inscription, and their warm friendship lasted for many years. The main consequence of this period was that A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov became interested in submillimeter-wave spectroscopy. At that time it was an almost untouched scientific field.</p> <p>A spectrometer with BWO and (radio)acoustic detector (RAD) appeared as an answer to the question: Why strong molecular lines are barely visible on a submillimeter microwave detector, although they absorb the entire radiation power of generators (1&ndash;10 mW). Also, the observation was greatly hindered by the unavoidable radiation interference pattern at the point where the detector was located. The acoustic detector is a volumetric receiver. It practically &ldquo;does not see&rdquo; interference and has a frequency-independent sensitivity. The detector ideally matches a wide range of tuning of a BWO frequency. RAD was built in 1970 with the active participation of S.P.&nbsp;Belov, who was a graduate student of Andrey Fedorovich. The first PLL system of a submillimeter-wave BWO was developed the same year. As a radio technical support for Krupnov’s group, cooperation began with L.I.&nbsp;Gerstein from the Bureau of Measuring Devices of NIRFI. It lasted for more than 10 years and led to the creation of the first frequency synthesizers continuously covering the entire sub-THz frequency range. The development of RAD was the reason for the invitation of A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov to an international <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308795116_PRAHA_International_Conferenc\nes_on_High_Resolution_Molecular_Spectroscopy_-_Internet_Archive\" target=\"_blank\">conference in Prague</a> in 1972, where, by a happy coincidence, many world leaders of molecular spectroscopy gathered: G.&nbsp;Hertzberg, D.&nbsp;Watson, D.&nbsp;Hougen, K.N.&nbsp;Rao… This paved the way for long-term cooperation between A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov and his group with leading world laboratories.</p> <p>Krupnov defended his doctoral work at the <a href=\"https://www.lebedev.ru/en/institute.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lebedev Physical Institute</a> in 1975. The seminar was made at the Department headed by A.M.&nbsp;Prokhorov, and the defence took place in the Council headed by N.G.&nbsp;Basov. A curious thing happened &mdash; one of the suggested reviewers backed off from the commitment at the last moment, saying that something unreal was claimed in the thesis, as there was no noise in the recordings of lines. The point was that the noise was not visible because the sensitivity was orders of magnitude higher than usual.</p> <p>In 1976, the submillimeter-wave spectroscopy technique developed by Krupnov's team found its place in the series &ldquo;Methods of Experimental Physics&rdquo; (vol.&nbsp;13 &ldquo;Spectroscopy&rdquo;, Academic Press, USA). The same year, Krupnov received an invitation to join the editorial board of the Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy, where he served for 33 years, during which the journal changed three editors and two publishers.</p> <p>A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov worked at the NIRFI until 1977. In 1977, when the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP) of the USSR Academy of Sciences was established, the Department of Microwave Spectroscopy was organized and headed by A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov. Soon after, the IAP director A.V.&nbsp;Gaponov-Grekhov invited him to give a talk at a meeting of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences. It was something like the &ldquo;first presentation&rdquo; of the new institute to the academic community. The success of the report (it was published in the Bulletin of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, 1978) was expressed in the remark by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Kapitsa\" target=\"_blank\">P.L.&nbsp;Kapitsa</a>: &ldquo;Beautiful work!&rdquo;</p> <p>The USSR State Prize (the first in the IAP) was awarded in 1980 to A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov and L.I.&nbsp;Gerstein together with A.M.&nbsp;Prokhorov, M.B.&nbsp;Golant and others for &ldquo;the creation of submillimeter-wave spectroscopy based on backward-wave oscillators&rdquo;.</p> <p>In the late seventies and in the eighties, many Krupnov's works were related to the study of molecular spectra in the submillimeter wavelength range that opened up for spectroscopic research. They were reflected in a number of reviews. In particular, John Sheridan noticed in 1983 that almost all developments in microwave spectroscopy belong to American researchers, and only two to European. These two are the double resonance method of Prof.&nbsp;Gozzini from Pisa and the RAD spectrometer from Gorky. The joint Prize of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences &ldquo;For the study of the fine structure of the spectra of non-rigid molecules&rdquo; was received in 1982.</p> <p>The popular scientific monograph &ldquo;Microwave Spectroscopy&rdquo;, encouraged by N.G.&nbsp;Basov, was written by A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov and published by &ldquo;Znanie&rdquo; publishing house in 1985. It turned out to be very helpful for introducing students to this field of science, so its revised editions appeared in 2009 and in 2021.</p> <p>In 1985, Krupnov initiated co-operation with the Institute of Electronic Measurements KVARZ aimed at the development of the industrial millimeter frequency synthesizers based on packetized BWO. These instruments were sold worldwide. In the hard 1990s, the wide international collaboration established by Krupnov’s department allowed the team to survive. One of the most prominent results of this period was the development in 1994&ndash;1995 of a wide-range scanning terahertz spectrometer with a BWO-based frequency synthesizer with a PLL system and a liquid helium cooled bolometer. The spectrometer was built at the University of Cologne and with its funding. The University is very proud of this device. Later, this technique was reproduced and successfully applied to the study of spectra in dozens of laboratories in different countries.</p> <p>In 1998&ndash;1999, A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov opens up still another new page in the history of the development of the Department of Microwave Spectroscopy at the Institute of Applied Physics. He found the way to implement the idea of fast precision digital control of BWO frequency in the PLL mode without phase jumps during frequency switching. By controlling the radiation source in the resonator spectrometer in the proposed way it became possible to exceed the sensitivity of all known world analogues by an order of magnitude. The block-diagram of this spectrometer from the article in the July 2000 issue of the Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy appeared on the journal cover. This device was also noticed almost immediately and highly evaluated by the international scientific community.</p> <p>The work of A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov at KVARZ was active and fruitful. For many years he was a consulting professor there, member of the Defence Council and even member of the Problem Council of the Upper Volga Branch of the Academy of Technological Sciences of the Russian Federation. In addition to the above-mentioned industrial frequency synthesizers, a RAD spectrometer was developed and produced under his leadership (one of these devices was used in the Academy of Chemical Defence of the Russian Federation). Krupnov's experience in the field of masers was in demand in another KVARZ’s department, where high-precision molecular and atomic clocks were developed. During the years of perestroika this direction was slowly &ldquo;dying&rdquo; together with KVARZ but was saved by enthusiasts. Despite the enormous difficulties, they were able not only to deploy high-tech production in a small rented room, but also to enter the world market with competitive products. It is about the Nizhny Novgorod company <a href=\"https://www.vremya-ch.com\" target=\"_blank\">VREMYA-CH</a> that produces, among other things, the frequency and time standards based on which the Russian satellite positioning system <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS\" target=\"_blank\">GLONASS</a> operates. If you get to the reception of the director of the company, pay attention to the portrait of A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov next to the portrait of the President of the Russian Federation.</p> <p>A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov headed the department until 2005, and then, almost to the last day, continued to work as a general research associate. A prominent result of this period was deflating of the concept of the so-called &ldquo;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.81.022706\" target=\"_blank\">dark water</a>&rdquo;, which could have very tangible consequences for astrophysics. The concept arose as a result of an erroneous interpretation of measurements of the collisional cross section of a water molecule with hydrogen molecules at very low temperatures at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory USA. In the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.82.036703\" target=\"_blank\">response article</a> Krupnov pointed out that the reason for the abnormal behavior is the predominant adsorption of ortho-hydrogen by the walls of the spectrometer and, consequently, the predominant collisions with para-hydrogen.</p> <p>Exactly 60 years passed between the first and last scientific papers of A.F.&nbsp;Krupnov. It is noteworthy that both of these articles were published in the journal &ldquo;<a href=\"https://radiophysics.unn.ru/\" target=\"_blank\">Radiophysics</a>&rdquo; published in Nizhny Novgorod. In his 2019 article, he put forward the idea of another application of the radiation of powerful <a href=\"https://ipfran.ru/science/high-power-electronics/gyroresonance/the-gyrotrons-for-UTS\" target=\"_blank\">gyrotrons</a> that is one of the main scientific directions of the IAP RAS it is proud of. Heating of a column of atmospheric air over its entire volume by vertically directed gyrotron radiation should lead to an upward convective flow, which will, for example, easily ventilate a deep open coal pit or quickly clear the city from smog or dust. Perhaps this idea will still find its &ldquo;knight of the project&rdquo;.</p> <p>Speaking about the role played by Andrey Fedorovich in national and world science, we can’t ignore his pupils. His relentless efforts and personal example enabled creating, training and educating a concerted research team, which successfully continues the best traditions of the Nizhny Novgorod school of radiophysicists. Many of his students and employees worked and continue to work in leading foreign laboratories. Affiliation with Krupnov’s school has long been a sign of the highest qualification in world spectroscopy, a kind of a scientific brand.</p>",

He graduated from high school in the Barmino village (Gorky region) in 1964. In 1965 he entered the Gorky City Polytechnical Institute named after A.A. Zhdanov and received a master diploma of radio engineer in 1970. On graduation he was employed at the Radiophysical Research Institute (RRI). In April 1977 the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP) branched off from the RRI and A.P. Shkaev moved over to it together with many other employees. Since that time he was with IAP as an engineer, senior engineer and leading engineer until August 2023. He was never the employee of our Laboratory but permanently helped us with various sophisticated radio devices. His close collaboration with us started in 1994, when the Laboratory initiated the development of Phase-Locked Loop systems for continuously scanning broad band molecular spectroscopy in the subterahertz spectral range (see [<a href=\"index.html#/list/1995\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;1 (1995)</a>] as the first result of this break-through). His <a href=\"index.html#/instrum/devices/dev012\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;BWO Synchronizer&rdquo;</a> is one of the key elements of the system. It successfully operates with minor modifications not only in all our spectrometers but also in many spectroscopic and other research laboratories around the world.</p>",
