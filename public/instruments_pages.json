Further precise control of the tube output radiation is performed by controlling the 10&ndash;12&nbsp;GHz signal of the base block by PC through GPIB interface.</p><p>Fast digital frequency sweeping of output radiation within 200&nbsp;MHz range is possible using a radio frequency (20&ndash;50&nbsp;MHz) fast direct digital synthesizer as a reference signal source for the synchronizer (<a href=\"index.html#/instrum/devices/dev012\" target=\"_blank\">Device 012</a>).

The system performs stabilization of sumbillimeter-wave radiation frequency against harmonic of radiation of millimeter-wave synthesizer, so the function of controlling the source is passed to the synthesizer. The synthesizer is one of the crucial parts of the system since the basic properties of output submillimeter-wave radiation such as spectrum purity and bandwidth, frequency stability and accuracy, scanning abilities and step-width etc. are determined by the corresponding properties of the synthesizer but multiplied by the number of the harmonic used for PLL stabilization. The synthesizer and consequently output submillimeter-wave radiation is computer controlled through standard GPIB interface. Another crucial element of the system is specially developed in our laboratory broad-band quasi-optical multiplier-mixer (<a href=\"index.html#/instrum/devices/dev006\" target=\"_blank\">Device 006</a>). The multiplier-mixer consists of a planar Schottky diode, mounted at the end of a ridged 3-millimeter waveguide.

Then the operation range of the system was extended step by step up to 500&nbsp;GHz in 1976, up to 600&nbsp;GHz in 1979, up to 820&nbsp;GHz in 1984. The next considerable step towards a high frequency range we made after joint development with the Institute of Electronic Measurements &ldquo;Kvarz&rdquo; (Nizhny Novgorod) of a series of commercial millimeter-wave frequency synthesizers covering all together the  35&ndash;178&nbsp;GHz [<a href=\"index.html#/list/1994\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;12 (1994)</a>] (<a href=\"index.html#/instrum/devices/dev005\" target=\"_blank\">Device 005</a>). The synthesizers are based on packetized BWOs from &ldquo;Istok&rdquo; stabilized by a PLL system against a stable radio signal. The synthesizers were used as a source of reference radiation for stabilization of submillimeter-wave tubes as well as primary radiation sources. In 1994 working in collaboration with Cologne's University (Germany) we introduced the BWO PLL system operating up to 970&nbsp;GHz [<a href=\"index.html#/list/1994\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;1 (1994)</a>].

In 1999 [<a href=\"index.html#/list/1999\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;10 (1999)</a>] we developed the first PLL system for MM-SubMM radiation sources allowing fast phase continuous digital frequency sweeping. Later [<a href=\"index.html#/list/2006\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;2 (2006)</a>] we proposed the approach, which extends the range of the fast continuous phase frequency sweeping up to the full operating range of BWO. In 2009 we demonstrated for the first time the possibility of phase stabilization of primary subTHz radiation source against components of terahertz frequency comb produced by down converting optical comb generated by a femtosecond laser [<a href=\"index.html#/list/2010\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;3 (2010)</a>].</p><p>For more details see the papers [<a href=\"index.html#/list/1996\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;7 (1996)</a>, <a href=\"index.html#/list/1998\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;5 (1998)</a>, <a href=\"index.html#/list/2001\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;20 (2001)</a>, <a href=\"index.html#/list/2012\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;7 (2012)</a>].</p>"

The cell is filled by gas with well known spectrum. Observed spectral lines are recorded and analyzed by PC. The following properties of the acoustic detector in addition to its high sensitivity make it a crucial element of the method: (i) sensitivity of radio-acoustic detector is independent of frequency range, polarization and space mode of the radiation; (ii) there is no signal from the acoustic detector if there is no absorption in the spectral line of gas inside the cell; (iii) output signal has linear dependence on the radiation power which was absorbed inside the gas cell. Thus a minor power of a few nanowatts at any particular harmonic may be detected in spite of the fact that at the same time hundreds of milliwatts of fundamental power and other harmonics are passing through the cell but do not produce any signal. So spectral lines of the gas  the frequency-selective element which allows us to distinguishing one harmonic from another and the latters from the fundamental. The main criterion of identification of observed line is coincidence of its frequency with calculated line frequency taken from the spectrum data base. The use of PLL stabilization of the fundamental radiation source supports the method with such high accuracy of line frequency measurement that the line identification is undoubted. The observed spectral line width is an additional criterion for the line identification. Due to the principal of lines observation the frequency step of radiation scanning through a range is determined by frequency step of fundamental radiation, but for radiation at harmonics the value of the step should be multiplied by corresponding harmonic number. So if the harmonic number is higher, then narrower is the linewidth of observed line. The amplitude of the observed line is in direct proportion to the line intensity (except the case of too strong absorption which can be estimated beforehand) and to the power of radiation. So comparison of the amplitude of observed lines with known intensities allows quantitative comparison of power at different harmonics. In particular, such important characteristic of multiplier as conversion losses can be determined. Dynamic range of such measurements is limited by the acoustic sell sensitivity; in our experiment it was about 55&nbsp;dB. Accuracy of the method is limited by variation of power of radiation inside the acoustic cell due to parasitic interference when radiation frequency changes from one line to another. In our experiments the accuracy of measurements was about 20&nbsp;%. Use of this method permitted for the first time to make tuning and adjusting of submillimeter-wave multipliers at every harmonic in real time.</p><p><a href=\"index.html#/instrum/mult_1/mult_1_3\">MM radiation multipliers conversion losses measurement</a></p><p><a href=\"index.html#/instrum/mult_2/mult_2_2\">SMM radiation multiplier conversion losses measurement</a></p><p>See the paper [<a href=\"index.html#/list/2000\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;1 (2000)</a>] for more details on the method and its applications.</p>"

The spectrometer allows observation of narrow non-linear molecular absorption resonances (Lamb-dips) having minimum width of about 5&nbsp;kHz (FWHM) and measurements of their frequencies with the accuracy better than 1&nbsp;kHz. The spectrometer is destined for highly accurate investigation of intramolecular interactions by studies of hyperfine structure of observed molecular transitions.</p>"
