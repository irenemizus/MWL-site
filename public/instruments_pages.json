The system performs stabilization of sumbillimeter-wave radiation frequency against harmonic of radiation of millimeter-wave synthesizer, so the function of controlling the source is passed to the synthesizer. The synthesizer is one of the crucial parts of the system since the basic properties of output submillimeter-wave radiation such as spectrum purity and bandwidth, frequency stability and accuracy, scanning abilities and step-width etc. are determined by the corresponding properties of the synthesizer but multiplied by the number of the harmonic used for PLL stabilization. The synthesizer and consequently output submillimeter-wave radiation is computer controlled through standard GPIB interface. Another crucial element of the system is specially developed in our laboratory broad-band quasi-optical multiplier-mixer (<a href=\"index.html#/instrum/devices/dev006\" target=\"_blank\">Device 006</a>). The multiplier-mixer consists of a planar Schottky diode, mounted at the end of a ridged 3-millimeter waveguide.

Then the operation range of the system was extended step by step up to 500&nbsp;GHz in 1976, up to 600&nbsp;GHz in 1979, up to 820&nbsp;GHz in 1984. The next considerable step towards a high frequency range we made after joint development with the Institute of Electronic Measurements &ldquo;Kvarz&rdquo; (Nizhny Novgorod) of a series of commercial millimeter-wave frequency synthesizers covering all together the  35&ndash;178&nbsp;GHz [<a href=\"index.html#/list/1994\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;12 (1994)</a>] (<a href=\"index.html#/instrum/devices/dev005\" target=\"_blank\">Device 005</a>). The synthesizers are based on packetized BWOs from &ldquo;Istok&rdquo; stabilized by a PLL system against a stable radio signal. The synthesizers were used as a source of reference radiation for stabilization of submillimeter-wave tubes as well as primary radiation sources. In 1994 working in collaboration with Cologne's University (Germany) we introduced the BWO PLL system operating up to 970&nbsp;GHz [<a href=\"index.html#/list/1994\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;1 (1994)</a>]. Later the range of the setup was extended up to the range of highest frequency tube &mdash; 1267&nbsp;GHz [<a href=\"index.html#/list/1995\" target=\"_blank\">Refs.&nbsp;13,&nbsp;18 (1995)</a>], [<a href=\"index.html#/list/1996\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;15 (1996)</a>], [<a href=\"index.html#/list/1997\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;1 (1997)</a>]. In 1999 [<a href=\"index.html#/list/1999\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;10 (1999)</a>] we developed the first PLL system for MM-SubMM radiation sources allowing fast phase continuous digital frequency sweeping. Later [<a href=\"index.html#/list/2006\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;2 (2006)</a>] we proposed the approach, which extends the range of the fast continuous phase frequency sweeping up to the full operating range of BWO. In 2009 we demonstrated for the first time the possibility of phase stabilization of primary subTHz radiation source against components of terahertz frequency comb produced by down converting optical comb generated by a femtosecond laser [<a href=\"index.html#/list/2010\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;3 (2010)</a>].

The cell is filled by gas with well known spectrum. Observed spectral lines are recorded and analyzed by PC. The following properties of the acoustic detector in addition to its high sensitivity make it a crucial element of the method: (i)&nbsp;sensitivity of radio-acoustic detector is independent of frequency range, polarization and space mode of the radiation; (ii)&nbsp;there is no signal from the acoustic detector if there is no absorption in the spectral line of gas inside the cell; (iii)&nbsp;output signal has linear dependence on the radiation power which was absorbed inside the gas cell. Thus a minor power of a few nanowatts at any particular harmonic may be detected in spite of the fact that at the same time hundreds of milliwatts of fundamental power and other harmonics are passing through the cell but do not produce any signal. So spectral lines of the gas  the frequency-selective element which allows us to distinguishing one harmonic from another and the latters from the fundamental. The main criterion of identification of observed line is coincidence of its frequency with calculated line frequency taken from the spectrum data base. The use of PLL stabilization of the fundamental radiation source supports the method with such high accuracy of line frequency measurement that the line identification is undoubted. The observed spectral line width is an additional criterion for the line identification. Due to the principal of lines observation the frequency step of radiation scanning through a range is determined by frequency step of fundamental radiation, but for radiation at harmonics the value of the step should be multiplied by corresponding harmonic number. So if the harmonic number is higher, then narrower is the linewidth of observed line. The amplitude of the observed line is in direct proportion to the line intensity (except the case of too strong absorption which can be estimated beforehand) and to the power of radiation. So comparison of the amplitude of observed lines with known intensities allows quantitative comparison of power at different harmonics. In particular, such important characteristic of multiplier as conversion losses can be determined. Dynamic range of such measurements is limited by the acoustic sell sensitivity; in our experiment it was about 55&nbsp;dB. Accuracy of the method is limited by variation of power of radiation inside the acoustic cell due to parasitic interference when radiation frequency changes from one line to another. In our experiments the accuracy of measurements was about 20&nbsp;%. Use of this method permitted for the first time to make tuning and adjusting of submillimeter-wave multipliers at every harmonic in real time.</p><p><a href=\"index.html#/instrum/mult_1/mult_1_3\">MM radiation multipliers conversion losses measurement</a></p><p><a href=\"index.html#/instrum/mult_2/mult_2_2\">SMM radiation multiplier conversion losses measurement</a></p><p>See the paper [<a href=\"index.html#/list/2000\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;1 (2000)</a>] for more details on the method and its applications.</p>"

Equation (2) relates the gas and membrane elasticities and provides the most effective transformation of the pressure variations into membrane displacements. Calculations are made for the real case in which the membrane elasticity is defined by its initial tension and the frequency of free oscillations of the membrane in vacuum is much greater than the modulation frequency. Here <em>p</em> is the gas pressure, <em>V</em> is the cell volume, <em>R</em> and <em>T</em><sup> *</sup> are the radius and initial tension of the membrane (<em>T</em><sup> *</sup> is the force per unit edge length). Analysis of these matching conditions and the expression for the signal strength obtained in this case permit the following conclusions: (i)&nbsp;when the matching conditions are fulfilled, the signal increases slowly with decreasing modulation frequency. The minimum modulation frequency is then defined by environmental noise; (ii)&nbsp;the operating pressure is sufficiently strictly defined by the desired resolving power of the spectrometer. Hence from Eq.&nbsp;(1) we obtain the value of the smallest (transverse) dimension of the cell; (iii)&nbsp;for given membrane parameters the signal strength increases with increasing cell length only up to a value defined by Eq.&nbsp;(2). Upon further increasing the cell length, the signal strength is saturated; (iv)&nbsp;the dependence of the matching Eqs.&nbsp;(1) and (2) on the gas pressure leads to the dependence of the output signal on pressure.</p><p>The realization of the matching condition <span class=\"nobr\"><em>m</em> &Gt; 1</span> at small gas pressures is the most difficult problem in practice, even when rather thin membranes are used (a membrane is stiffer than gas, <span class=\"nobr\"><em>m</em> &Lt; 1</span>). In this case the signal drops proportionally to <em>m</em>. The maximum close approach to fulfillment of Eq.&nbsp;(2) is very desirable from the point of view of requirements for the sensitivity of the electronics circuit.</p><p>The spectrometer output noise is defined by the thermal fluctuations of the microphone membrane in the gas (both due to inherent Brownian motion of the membrane and to Brownian motion of the gas) and by the inherent noise of the electronics circuit. The limiting sensitivity of the spectrometer is obtained when the thermal fluctuations of the membrane are defined preferably by Brownian motion of the gas. In this case the parameters are practically unrestricted, since the gas noise and the signal are similarly transformed into membrane displacements. Only the weak dependence on the cell length remains. The signal-to-noise ratio increases as <em>l</em><sup>1/2</sup>, because the effective volume thermal noise sources do not correlate between each other, but the signal sources do. In the absence of line saturation for <span class=\"nobr\"><em>T</em> = 300&nbsp;°K</span>, <em>l</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10&nbsp;cm, an integration time of 1&nbsp;sec., and a typical gas thermal conductivity, one may obtain the following estimate for the limiting absorption coefficient sensitivity of the RAD:</p><p class=\"eq\"><span class=\"nobr\"><em>g</em><sub>min</sub>(cm<sup>-1</sup>) &Gt; 4 x 10<sup>-11</sup> / <em>P</em><sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)</span></p><p>where <em>P</em><sub>0</sub> is in Watts. An analogous estimate may be obtained more roughly using Eq.&nbsp;(4) and the expression for the signal power <span class=\"nobr\"><em>P</em><sub>s</sub> &Gt; <em>glP</em><sub>0</sub></span>. Let us consider the possibilities of achieving this ultimate sensitivity.</p><p>The rms displacement of the center of the membrane due to fluctuations connected with Brownian motion in the gas (at <span class=\"nobr\"><em>w</em><sub>M</sub><em>t</em><sup> cell</sup> &Gt; 1</span>, <span class=\"nobr\"><em>m</em> &Lt; 1</span>) in the receiver bandwidth <span class=\"nobr\"><em>Dw</em><sup> rec</sup></span> near the modulation frequency is equal to</p><p class=\"eq\"><span class=\"nobr\"><em>s</em><sub>g</sub> &Gt; (1/4<em>&rho;</em>)(<em>kTm</em> <em>Dw</em><sup> rec</sup> / <em>T</em><sup> *</sup><em>Dw</em><sup> cell</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)</span></p><p>and that due to the inherent membrane Brownian motion is</p><p class=\"eq\"><span class=\"nobr\"><em>s</em><sub>m</sub> &Gt; (1/<em>&rho;</em>)(<em>kT</em> <em>Dw</em><sup> rec</sup> / 2<em>Q</em><sub>M</sub><em>WT</em><sup> *</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)</span></p><p>Here <em>W</em> and <em>Q</em><sub>M</sub> are the resonant frequency and quality factor of the membrane as a mechanical oscillator in vacuum.

When the cell is evacuated and filled with the gas to be investigated, considerable displacements of the membrane may occur. These must not influence the sensitivity of the microphone and circuit in the subsequent operation. The most suitable circuit for fulfilling these conditions is the high-frequency bridge condenser microphone circuit with the microphone capacity included in one resonant bridge arm. It will be shown below that the sensitivity of such a circuit is sufficient for detection of gas fluctuations. The use of an automatic bridge balance along two coordinates (microphone capacity by electrostatic control of the membrane position, the circuit losses by an electrically controlled resistor) provides constant sensitivity of the microphone and the circuit.</p><p>When the bridge is fed by a quartz oscillator with a sufficiently pure spectrum, then the noise in the narrow sidebands <em>Dw</em><sup> rec</sup> at the frequencies <span class=\"nobr\"><em>w</em><sub>q</sub> ± <em>w</em><sub>M</sub></span> is caused only by thermal fluctuations in the resonant bridge arms and the circuit sensitivity is equal to</p><p class=\"eq\"><span class=\"nobr\"><em>s</em><sub>c</sub> &Gt; (1/<em>Q</em>)(8/<em>&rho;</em>)(1/2)(<em>kT</em> <em>Dw</em><sup> rec</sup> / <em>P</em><sub>q</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup><em>d</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)</span></p><p>Here <em>w</em><sub>q</sub> is the quartz oscillator frequency, <em>Q</em> is the quality factor of the microphone resonant circuit at the frequency <em>w</em><sub>q</sub>, <em>P</em><sub>q</sub> is the power dissipated in this circuit, <em>d</em> is the distance between the membrane and the other electrode of the microphone. The value <em>Q</em> is defined by the losses in the thin conductive layer on the membrane and is approximately equal to 10<sup>2</sup>.

Both synthesizers are computer-controlled. As a result, BWO frequency is defined as</p><p class=\"eq\"><span class=\"nobr\"><em>f</em><sub>BWO</sub> = <em>n</em> · <em>f</em><sub>MW</sub> &ndash; 10 · <em>f</em><sub>RF</sub>,</span></p><p>where <em>n</em> varied from 4 to 20, and factor 10 before <em>f</em><sub>RF</sub> appears because phase detection is done at 10 times digitally divided intermediate frequency (IF), which was 350&nbsp;MHz. The main source of error in measurement of the resonance width is the drift of the central frequency of resonance during the measurement. To minimize this error one has to measure the resonance curve as fast as physically possible. Response time of the resonator itself <span class=\"nobr\"><em>t</em> ~ 1/<em>p</em> &Delta;<em>f</em> ~ 2 microseconds</span>. For precision measurement the observation time should be increased, say, ten times, i.e., up to ~&nbsp;20 microseconds. Microwave and millimeter-wave synthesizers commonly used for spectroscopy, employ indirect frequency synthesis and so have ~&nbsp;10&nbsp;·&nbsp;50&nbsp;millisecond switching time, thus preventing fast scanning of the resonance curve. Fast direct radio frequency synthesizer with switching time ~&nbsp;200&nbsp;nanoseconds and time between switching 58 microseconds was used in this work as a source of reference signal for phase detector in the lock-in loop. Thus precision and fast scanning of the BWO radiation frequency within ~&nbsp;200&nbsp;MHz around the central frequency defined by microwave frequency synthesizer was achieved. Extension of the scanning range up to the full BWO frequency range is possible [<a href=\"index.html#/list/2006\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;2 (2006)</a>]. Scanning without loss of phase permits the physical limits of the resonance observation time to be approached and reduces the source phase noise. The passed through resonator radiation was received then by low-barrier Schottky diode detector. The precision frequency control, signal acquisition and processing were done by computer as it is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1 and will be explained below. Results of each scan were recorded and processed separately.</p><p>Automation system consisted of IBM PC and module containing RF synthesizer and data acquisition system. For minimization of ground-to-ground static the module is connected with PC by optically coupled interface. The core of the module is microprocessor with external memory. RF synthesizer is based on Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) microcircuit AD9850 of Analog Devices Inc. and it is able to generate harmonic signal in 20&ndash;40&nbsp;MHz range with 0.03&nbsp;Hz discreteness and without phase jumps at the switching. Data acquisition (digitizing of preamplified detector signal) is done by 12-digits ADC. Data are stored in a data memory. Microprocessor controls frequency of synthesizer and synchronizes the data acquisition process with frequency steps. Parameters of the synthesizer frequency tuning &mdash; starting frequency, value of frequency step, time of the next frequency step, number of points, frequency change law and number of scans &mdash; the microprocessor receives from PC. Time between frequency changing was chosen for our purpose as 60 microseconds per point. Frequency was changed by triangle law meaning forward and backward scan. Maximum number of points per scan was 512. In each frequency point microprocessor several times collects data from ADC, averages the obtained results and put the result of averaging into data memory. In such a way 32 of 512 points triangle scans may be put into local memory. The number of scans, which could be put into local memory, increases proportionally with reducing the number of points per scan. So process of registration of 32 scans with 512 points per scan takes 0.98&nbsp;sec. After the recording of ordered number of scans into local memory the data are transferred to PC for further processing.</p><p>The processing consists of least squares fitting of the results of each scan to Lorentzian with added linear (practice showed no necessity in quadratic term) and constant terms representing effects of interference in the tract in the vicinity of resonance, level of noise on detector and bias voltage of amplifier:</p>"

Moreover, the pairwise interaction, which binds the dimer appears to be of paramount importance for expounding a complete molecular description of the liquid and solid phases of water. However, there have been no secure, direct observations of water dimers at environmentally relevant temperatures despite decades of studies.</p><p>This topic has even survived two previous false detections published, respectively, in &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; (Gebbie <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> (1969)) and &ldquo;Science&rdquo; (K.&nbsp;Pfeilsticker <em>et&nbsp;al.</em> (2003)).

The dimer spectrum was studied over a broad range of pressures and temperatures relevant to the Earth’s atmosphere. A number of spectroscopic and thermodynamic parameters of the dimer was determined. Signal to noise ratio of observed dimer features allowed us to make the second key step toward understanding the role of the dimer in atmospheric processes: spectra of water vapor diluted by air clearly demonstrate expectable pressure broadening of the dimer features without noticeable reduction of their integrated intensity. This suggests the conclusion that the dimer equilibrium constant in the atmosphere is about the same as in pure water vapor [<a href=\"index.html#/list/2014\" target=\"_blank\">Ref.&nbsp;4 (2014)</a>].</p>",
